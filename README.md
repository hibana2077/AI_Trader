# AI Trader

## Introduction

This is a side project I am working on to learn more about reinforcement learning and stock trading. The goal is to create a reinforcement learning agent that can learn to trade stocks in a simulated environment. The agent will be trained on historical stock data and will be able to make decisions on whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. The agent will be rewarded for making good decisions and penalized for making bad decisions. The agent will be trained using the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) toolkit, and Deep Q-Learning will useing the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library. Data will be collected from [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) using the [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library.
